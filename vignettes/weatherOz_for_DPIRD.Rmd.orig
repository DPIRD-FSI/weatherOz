## Working With DPIRD Data

Three functions are provided to streamline fetching data from the DPIRD Weather 2.0 API endpoints.
 * `get_dpird_extremes()`, which returns the recorded extreme values for the given station in the DPIRD weather station network.;
 * `get_dpird_minute()`, which returns weather data in minute increments for stations in the DPIRD weather station network with only the past two years being available; and
 * `get_dpird_summaries()`, which returns weather data in 15 and 30 minute, hourly, daily, monthly or yearly summary values for stations in the DPIRD weather station network.

## Working With DPIRD Metadata

Three functions are provided to assist in fetching metadata about the stations.
 * `find_nearby_stations()`, which returns a `data.table` with the nearest weather stations to a given geographic point or known station either in the DPIRD or BOM (from SILO) networks.
 * `get_dpird_availability()`, which returns a `data.table` with the availability for weather stations in the DPIRD network providing the uptime and data availability for a given period of time.
 * `get_station_metadata()`, which returns a `data.table` with the latest and most up-to-date information available from the Weather 2.0 API on the stations' geographic locations, hardware details, *e.g.,* wind mast height, and recording capabilities.

### Getting Extreme Weather Values

This function fetches and returns nicely formatted individual extreme weather summaries from the DPIRD Weather 2.0 API.
You must provide a `station_code` and `API_key`, the other arguments, `values` and `include_closed` are optional.

#### Example 1: Get All Extremes for Northam, WA

```{r get_all_extremes}
library(weatherOz)

(extremes <- get_dpird_extremes(
  station_code = "NO",
  api_key = Sys.getenv("DPIRD_API_KEY")
))
```

#### Example 2: Get Selected Extremes for Northam, WA

Fetch only soil erosion extreme conditions for Northam, WA.
The documentation for `get_dpird_extremes()` contains a full listing of the values that are available to query from this API endpoint.

```{r get_selected_extremes}
library(weatherOz)

(
  extremes <- get_dpird_extremes(
    station_code = "NO",
    values = "erosionCondition",
    api_key = Sys.getenv("DPIRD_API_KEY")
  )
)
```

### Getting Minute Data

This function fetches nicely formatted minute weather station data from the DPIRD Weather 2.0 API for a maximum 24-hour period.
You must provide a `station_code` and `API_key`, the other arguments, `start_date_time`, `minutes` and `values` are optional.

#### Example 3: Get All Minute Data for the Past 24 Hours

```{r get_minute_data}
library(weatherOz)

(
  min_dat <- get_dpird_minute(
    station_code = "NO",
    api_key = Sys.getenv("DPIRD_API_KEY")
  )
)
```

#### Example 4: Get Specific Time and Date Data for Specific Values

If you wish to supply a specific start date and time and values, you may do so as shown here.

```{r minute_w_st_dt_and_values}
library(weatherOz)

(
  min_dat_t_rad_wind <- get_dpird_minute(
    station_code = "NO",
    start_date_time = "2023-02-01 13:00:00",
    minutes = 1440,
    values = c("airTemperature",
               "solarIrradiance",
               "wind"),
    api_key = Sys.getenv("DPIRD_API_KEY")
  )
)
```

### Getting Summary Data

This function fetches nicely formatted minute weather station data from the DPIRD Weather 2.0 API for a maximum 24-hour period.
You must provide a `station_code` and `API_key`, the other arguments, `start_date_time`, `minutes` and `values` are optional.

#### Example 5: Get Annual Rainfall Since 2017

Use the default value for end date (current system date) to get annual rainfall since 2017 until current year for Capel.

```{r yearly_data}
library(weatherOz)

(
  annual_rain <- get_dpird_summaries(
    station_code = "CL001",
    start_date = "20170101",
    api_key = Sys.getenv("DPIRD_API_KEY"),
    interval = "yearly",
    values = "rainfall"
  )
)
```

#### Example 6: Get Monthly Rainfall Since 2017

Use the default value for end date (current system date) to get monthly rainfall since 2017 until current year for Capel.

```{r monthly_values}
library(weatherOz)

(
  monthly_rain <- get_dpird_summaries(
    station_code = "CL001",
    start_date = "20170101",
    api_key = Sys.getenv("DPIRD_API_KEY"),
    interval = "monthly",
    values = "rainfall"
  )
)
```

#### Example 7: Get Daily Rainfall and Wind From Beginning of 2017 to End of 2018

Use the default value for end date (current system date) to get daily rainfall and wind records from 2017-01-01 to 2018-12-31 for Binnu.
Note that the Binnu station has two wind heights, 3m and 10m.

```{r daily_values}
library(weatherOz)

(
  daily_wind_rain <- get_dpird_summaries(
    station_code = "BI",
    start_date = "20170101",
    end_date = "2018-12-31",
    api_key = Sys.getenv("DPIRD_API_KEY"),
    interval = "daily",
    values = c("rainfall",
               "wind")
  )
)
```

#### Example 8: Get Hourly Rainfall and Wind From Beginning of 2022 to Current

Use the default value for end date (current system date) to get hourly rainfall and wind records from 2022-01-01 to Current Date for Binnu.
Note that the Binnu station has two wind heights, 3m and 10m.

```{r hourly_values}
library(weatherOz)

(
  hourly_wind_rain <- get_dpird_summaries(
    station_code = "BI",
    start_date = "20220101",
    api_key = Sys.getenv("DPIRD_API_KEY"),
    interval = "hourly",
    values = c("rainfall",
               "wind")
  )
)
```
