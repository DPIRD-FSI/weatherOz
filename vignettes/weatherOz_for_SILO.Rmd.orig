## Using {weatherOz} With SILO Data

Four functions are provided to streamline fetching data from the SILO API endpoints.
 * `get_data_drill(), which returns weather data from SILO's 0.05 x 0.05 degrees interpolated, gridded weather dataset;
 * `get_patched_point(), which returns weather data from a given BOM weather station (a point) in the SILO database where missing values are interpolated (patched);
 * `get_data_drill_apsim(), which returns data drill weather data in an {[apsimx]} `.met` class object with the weather data ready for use in APSIM; and
 * `get_data_drill_patched_point(), which returns patched point weather data in an {[apsimx]} `.met` class object with the weather data ready for use in APSIM.
