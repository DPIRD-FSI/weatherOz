## Introduction

{weatherOz} provides automated downloading, parsing, cleaning, and formatting
of weather data for Australia through API endpoints provided by the Department
of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) of Western Australia,
and by the Science and Technology Division of the Queensland Government's
Department of Environment and Science (DES).
As well as Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology ('BOM') précis and
coastal forecasts, agriculture bulletin data, and downloading and importing
radar and satellite imagery files.
DPIRD weather data are accessed through public APIs provided by DPIRD,
<https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/weather-api-20>, providing access to weather
station data from DPIRD's own weather station network.
Australia-wide weather data are based on data from the Australian Bureau of
Meteorology (BOM) data and accessed through SILO (Scientific Information for
Land Owners) (Jeffery et al., 2001).
BOM also serves several types of data data as XML, JSON and SHTML files.
This package fetches these files, parses them and return a data frame.
Satellite and radar imagery files are also made available to the public via anonymous FTP.
{weatherOz} provides functionality to query, fetch and create `terra::SpatRaster()` objects of the GeoTIFF imagery or a magick object of radar image gif files.

## Using {weatherOz}

Several functions are provided by {weatherOz} to retrieve Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) data.
A family of functions retrieve weather data and return data frames;
 * `get_precis_forecast()`, which retrieves the précis (short) forecast;
 * `get_ag_bulletin()`, which retrieves the agriculture bulletin;
 * `get_coastal_forecast()`, which fetches coastal waters forecasts for each state; and
A second family of functions retrieve information pertaining to satellite and radar imagery, `get_available_imagery()` and the imagery itself, `_imagery()` for satellite, and `get_available_radar()` and `get_radar_imagery()` for radar images.
The last group functions provides internal functionality for {weatherOz} itself; `update_forecast_towns()`, which updates an internal database of forecast locations distributed with the package, `update_ag_station_locations()`, which updates an internal database of the stations reporting ag bulletins and `find_forecast_towns()` and find_nearby_stations()` which returns either the closest forecast locations or the nearest weather stations with an ag bulletin to a given point in Australia.

## Using get_precis_forecast()

This function only takes one argument, `state`. The `state` parameter allows the user to select the forecast for just one state or a national forecast.
States or territories are specified using the official postal codes or full name with fuzzy matching performed via `agrep()`.

- **ACT** - Australian Capital Territory

- **NSW** - New South Wales

- **NT** - Northern Territory

- **QLD** - Queensland

- **SA** - South Australia

- **TAS** - Tasmania

- **VIC** - Victoria

- **WA** - Western Australia

- **AUS** - Australia, returns national forecast including all states, NT and ACT.

### Results

The function, `get_precis_forecast()`, will return a data frame of the weather forecast for the daily forecast for selected towns.
See Appendix 1 for a full description of the fields and values.

### Example

Following is an example fetching the forecast for Queensland.

```{r precis_forecast, eval=TRUE}
(QLD_forecast <- get_precis_forecast(state = "QLD"))
```


## Using get_ag_bulletin()

`get_ag_bulletin()` only takes one argument, `state`.
The `state` parameter allows the user to select the bulletin for just one state or a national forecast.
States or territories are specified using the official postal codes or full name with fuzzy matching performed via `agrep()`.

- **NSW** - New South Wales

- **NT** - Northern Territory

- **QLD** - Queensland

- **SA** - South Australia

- **TAS** - Tasmania

- **VIC** - Victoria

- **WA** - Western Australia

- **AUS** - Australia, returns bulletin for all states and NT.

### Results

The function, `get_ag_bulletin()`, will return a data frame of the agriculture bulletin for selected stations.
See Appendix 3 for a full list and description of the fields and values.

### Example

Following is an example fetching the ag bulletin for Queensland.

```{r ag_bulletin, eval=TRUE}
(QLD_bulletin <- get_ag_bulletin(state = "QLD"))
```

## Using get_coastal_forecast()

This function only takes one argument, `state`.
The `state` parameter allows the user to select the forecast for just one state or a national forecast.
States or territories are specified using the official postal codes or full name with fuzzy matching performed via `agrep()`

- **ACT** - Australian Capital Territory

- **NSW** - New South Wales

- **NT** - Northern Territory

- **QLD** - Queensland

- **SA** - South Australia

- **TAS** - Tasmania

- **VIC** - Victoria

- **WA** - Western Australia

- **AUS** - Australia, returns national forecast including all states, NT and ACT.

### Results

The function, `get_coastal_forecast()`, will return a data frame of the coastal waters forecast for marine zones in each state.
See Appendix 6 for a full description of the fields and values.

### Example

Following is an example fetching the forecast for Queensland.

```{r coastal_forecast, eval=TRUE}
(QLD_coastal_forecast <- get_coastal_forecast(state = "QLD"))
```


## Using find_nearby_stations()

`sweep_for_stations()` only takes one argument, `latlon`, a length-2 numeric vector.
By default, this is Canberra (approximately).

### Results

This function will search for weather stations and return a data frame of all weather stations (in this package) sorted by distance from `latlon`, ascending.
The fields in the data frame are:

**name** - station name

**lat** - latitude (decimal degrees)

**lon** - longitude (decimal degrees)

**distance** - distance from provided `latlon` value (kilometres).

### Example 1

Following is an example sweeping for stations starting with Canberra.
Note that this code chunk is not executed due to the need of an API key.
We get the station distances in this function from the DPIRD API so you will need to supply your own API key.

```{r find_stations, eval=FALSE}
# Show only the first ten stations in the list
find_nearby_stations(
  latitude = -35.4,
  longitude = 149.2,
  distance_km = 10,
  api_key = YOUR_API_KEY
)
```

## Using find_forecast_towns()

`find_forecast_towns()` only takes one argument, `latlon`, a length-2 numeric vector.
By default, this is Canberra (approximately).

### Results

This function will search for weather stations and return a data frame of all weather stations (in this package) sorted by distance from `latlon`, ascending.
The fields in the data frame are:

**name** - forecast town

**lat** - latitude (decimal degrees)

**lon** - longitude (decimal degrees)

**distance** - distance from provided `latlon` value (kilometres).

### Example

Following is an example sweeping for forecast towns starting with Canberra.
As this function is executed locally using great circle distances, it doesn't need an API key.

```{r sweep_forecast, eval=TRUE}
# Show only the first ten towns in the list
head(find_forecast_towns(latitude = -35.3, longitude = 149.2, distance_km = 10))
```

## Using the update functions

{weatherOz} uses internal databases of station location data from BOM to provide location and other metadata, _e.g._ elevation, station names, WMO codes, etc. to make the process of querying for weather data faster.
These databases are created and packaged with {weatherOz} for distribution and are updated with new releases.
Users have the option of updating these databases after installing {weatherOz}.
While this option gives the users the ability to keep the databases up-to-date and gives {weatherOz}'s authors flexibility in maintaining it, this also means that reproducibility may be affected since the same version of {wrapique} may have different databases on different machines.
If reproducibility is necessary, care should be taken to ensure that the version of the databases is the same across different machines.

The databases consist of three files, used by {weatherOz}, `AAC_codes.rda`, `JSONurl_latlon_by_station_name.rda` and `stations_site_list.rda`.
These files can be located on your local system by using the following command,

```{r, eval=FALSE}
paste0(.libPaths(), "/weatherOz/extdata")[1]
```

unless you have specified another location for library installations and installed {weatherOz} there, in which case it would still be in `wrapique/extdata`.

### Using update_forecast_towns()

`update_forecast_towns()` downloads the latest précis forecast locations from the BOM server and updates {weatherOz}'s internal database of towns used for forecast locations.
This database is distributed with the package to make the process faster when fetching the forecast.

### Example

Following is an example updating the précis forecast locations internal database.

```{r update_forecast_towns, eval=FALSE}
update_forecast_towns()
```

### Using update_station_locations

`update_station_locations()` downloads the latest station locations and metadata and updates {weatherOz}'s internal databases that support the use of `get_current_weather()` and `get_ag_bulletin()`.
There is no need to use this unless you know that a station exists in BOM's database that is not available in the databases distributed with {weatherOz}.

### Example

Following is an example updating the précis forecast locations internal database.

```{r update_station_locations, eval=FALSE}
update_station_locations()
```

## Using {weatherOz} to retrieve satellite imagery

{weatherOz} provides functionality to retrieve high-definition GeoTIFF satellite imagery provided by BOM through public FTP with the following types of imagery being available: i.) [Infrared images](http://www.bom.gov.au/australia/satellite/about_images.shtml#ir), ii.)
[Visible images](http://www.bom.gov.au/australia/satellite/about_images.shtml#vis) and iii.) [Clouds/surface composite](http://www.bom.gov.au/australia/satellite/about_images.shtml#cloud).

Valid BOM satellite Product IDs for GeoTIFF files include:

<table>
<tr><th>Product ID</th><th>Description</th><th>Type</th><th>Delete time</th></tr>
<tr><td>IDE00420</td><td>AHI cloud cover only 2km FD GEOS </td><td>Satellite</td><td style= "text-align: center;">24</td></tr>
<tr><td>IDE00421</td><td>AHI IR (Ch13) greyscale 2km FD GEOS </td><td>Satellite</td><td style= "text-align: center;">24</td></tr>
<tr><td>IDE00422</td><td>AHI VIS (Ch3) greyscale 2km FD GEOS </td><td>Satellite</td><td style= "text-align: center;">24</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan = 3><strong>Information gathered from Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM)</strong></td></tr>
</table>

### Using get_available_imagery()

`get_available_imagery()` only takes one argument, `product_id`, a BOM identifier for the imagery that you wish to check for available imagery.
Using this function will fetch a listing of BOM GeoTIFF satellite imagery from [ftp://ftp.bom.gov.au/anon/gen/gms/](ftp://ftp.bom.gov.au/anon/gen/gms/) to display which files are currently available for download.
These files are available at ten minute update frequency with a 24 hour delete time.
This function can be used see the most recent files available and then specify in the `_imagery()` function.
If no valid Product ID is supplied, defaults to all GeoTIFF images currently available.

```{r get_available_imagery, eval=TRUE}
(avail <- get_available_imagery(product_id = "IDE00425"))
```

### Using get_satellite_imagery()

`get_satellite_imagery()` fetches BOM satellite GeoTIFF imagery, returning a SpatRaster object and takes two arguments.
Files are available at ten minute update frequency with a 24 hour delete time.
It is suggested to check file availability first by using `get_available_imagery()`.
The arguments are:

- `product_id`, a character value of the BOM product ID to download.
Alternatively, a vector of values from `get_available_imagery()` may be used here.
This argument is mandatory.

- `scans` a numeric value for the number of scans to download, starting with the most recent and progressing backwards, *e.g.*, `1` - the most recent single scan available , `6` - the most recent hour available, `12` - the most recent 2 hours available, etc.
Negating will return the oldest files first.
Defaults to 1.
This argument is optional.

```{r get_satellite_imagery, eval=TRUE}
# Specify product ID and scans
i <- get_satellite_imagery(product_id = "IDE00425", scans = 1)

# Same, but use "avail" from prior to specify images for download
i <- get_satellite_imagery(product_id = avail, scans = 1)
```

`terra::plot()` has been re-exported to simplify visualising these files while using {weatherOz}.

```{r plot_satellite}
plot(i)
```

## Using {weatherOz} to retrieve radar imagery

{weatherOz} provides functionality to retrieve the latest radar imagery provided by BOM through public FTP.
These are the latest snapshots for each radar locations at various radar ranges _e.g._, 512km, 256km, 128km and 64km for some stations.

### Using get_available_radar()

`get_available_radar()` fetches the available radar imagery from the BOM FTP and returns a data frame for reference.
This data frame contains the product_id, which is required when using the `get_radar_imagery()` function.
The files available are the latest `.gif` files of BOM radar imagery which are typically updated each 6-10 minutes. Only the most recent image is retrieved for each radar location.
There are usually several radar ranges available for each radar location, such as 512km, 256km, 128km and possibly 64km.
The arguments are:

* `radar_id`  which is the BOM radar ID number; this defaults to 'all' which will return a data frame of all radar IDs in Australia.

```{r, get_available_radar}
x <- get_available_radar()
head(x)
```

### Using get_radar_imagery()

`get_radar_imagery()` fetches the latest BOM radar imagery for a given product ID.
The files available are the latest `.gif` files of BOM radar imagery, which are typically updated each 6-10 minutes.
Only the most recent image is retrieved for each radar location.
There are usually several radar ranges available for each radar location, such as 512km, 256km, 128km and possibly 64km.
The only argument is:

* `product_id` the BOM product_id associated with each radar imagery file.
These can be obtained from the `get_available_radar()` function.
This value must be specified and the function will accept only one at a time.

```{r get_radar_imagery, fig.height=9, fig.width=8}
y <- get_radar_imagery(product_id = "IDR032")
plot(y)
```
