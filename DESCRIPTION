Description: Provides automated downloading, parsing, cleaning, and formatting
    of weather data for Australia through API endpoints provided by the
    Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) of Western
    Australia and by the Science and Technology Division of the Queensland
    Government's Department of Environment and Science (DES). DPIRD weather data
    are accessed through DPIRD's public APIs,
    <https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/weather-api-20>, providing access to weather
    station data from DPIRD's weather station network. Australia-wide data are
    based on data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) data and
    accessed through SILO (Scientific Information for Land Owners) (Jeffery et
    al., 2001, <doi: 10.1016/S1364-8152(01)00008-1>).
