# weatherOz 0.0.1.9000

## Bug fixes

* Fixed [bug](https://github.com/DPIRD-FSI/weatherOz/issues/35) where `find_forecast_town()` returned all values, not the proper values.

* Fixed example in `get_dpird_extremes()` that didn't use "your_api_key" as all other examples did for error checking.

* Fix the re-export of `terra::plot()`.

* Fix example for `get_dpird_extremes()` that didn't follow the package's standard use of "your_api_key" for the `api_key` value in the example.

# weatherOz 0.0.1

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
